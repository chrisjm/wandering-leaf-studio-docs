# Wandering Leaf Studios LLC: Frequently Asked Questions

## What is your rate?

We don't have this public for a variety of reasons. Please [contact us](mailto: chris.mears@gmail.com) to schedule a chat on how we may work together.

## What is your evaluation cost?

We charge a one-time, non-refundable evaluation fee of $500 USD. This covers the time required to discuss the project, review the existing codebase (if necessary), and come up with a project proposal / statement of work.

## What is your response time commitment?

If you are a client, we are committed to getting back to you within 24 hours. If you are not a client, we still strive to respond within 24 hours, but it may take 48-36 hours.

## Do you do rush jobs (ie. projects which need to be released within 4-6 weeks)?

No. We have other clients and project deadlines that are on schedules, so we typically don't have time or resources to handle rush projects.
