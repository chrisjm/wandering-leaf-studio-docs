# Wandering Leaf Studios LLC: Client Guide

*This document describes our process as well as common questions and pitfalls of software development, and how we work to mitigate them.*

## DISCOVERY &mdash; Becoming our client

*The DISCOVERY phase is to understand and analyze the core problem you want to solve, understanding what assumptions you're making, while brainstorming a variety of potential solutions. We want to know why you're building this, and want makes you unique.*

### Getting in touch

We love email! Send us an email at info@wanderingleastudios.com with a brief description of your project and how you see us working with you.

### Understanding the project

After we have read your email, we will schedule a time to talk with you. The things we will want to know are:

* Who you are as an organization,
* Why you're building what you're building,
* What makes it (and you) special,
* Why you think we are the right fit, and
* Anything else that you feel is important.

### Receiving an estimate

After better understand your project and learning more about you and your goals, we will work to put together an estimate for you. As part of this process, we will write a short (one to two page) document describing:

* How we understand your product
* Feature list
* Required investment and invoicing terms

Sometimes ideas are too vague or too large in scope for us to set project price. In this case, we have options:

* We can (and often do) work in phases using blocks of hours working against a top priorities list
* We can choose a subset of the full feature list

### How much will by website/web application cost?

How much does building a custom house cost? It depends on what you want, and how refined the details are. Are you building a barn or a luxury mansion?

Our projects range from five-page WordPress marketing sites to fully-developed web applications, which is typically somewhere between $x,xxx and $xx,xxx.

Our sweet spot (ie. entrepreneurs building out their first early version of their product or building upon their existing product) have budgets in the mid-5-figure range.

### How long will it take?

Most of our minimum viable product (MVP) applications take about 8 to 10 weeks to deliver functional, working software. Small marketing sites take 2-3 weeks. However, this is dependent on the project scope and how many changes happen over the duration of the project.

### What do I get?

We will act as your software development partner. This means we will act like your product is our product. We will make arguments for some features we should build and for features that we should not build. We are building the functioning product, and will make sure that we deploy the product in an environment where it can grow and handle expected traffic.

We use source control (typically Github), which ensures that if we make coding errors, we can roll back easily to previous working versions. We will also employ an easy deployment process so that new versions/iterations can be released without worry.

Finally, we will document everything (diagrams, process, etc.).

## (DEFINE) What happens after I say "yes" to Wandering Leaf Studios LLC?

*The DEFINE phase is in place to narrow down the best solution, define the project scope and features, and then assign appropriate team members and resources.*

### You might have to wait a little

We are busy, which is great because it means we have projects to work on that we care about. However, this can mean that we won't be able to start your project right away. We usually kick-off projects within two weeks of a signed agreement.

Us being busy also means we are unable to do "rush" jobs (ie. projects which need to be completed in 4-6 weeks).

### We define and redefine what we should build next

Based on our estimate, our team will create a Trello board with our version of the priority list of items to work on. These will be the highest technical risk areas (and our approach to understand them).

We will also create a list of items that we will need from you before we can begin the work. Some of the items will include:

* indentity/branding elements (e.g. logos and colors)
* copy for the pages

We will share everything at the kick-off meeting.

### We schedule a kickoff meeting

A kick-off meeting is our turn to discuss our plan with you and get your feedback on what should be priority. We will walk you through our project tracking tool (and your role in it). We will walk through what information we are still waiting on from you and make sure we are on the same page.

### We schedule a start date

Within two weeks (sometimes the day after) of the kickoff meeting, we will begin work. The start date allows you to know when you should start expecting updates and start seeing results.

## (DEVELOP) What happens when the work begins?

*The DEVELOP phase is where we'll begin implementing code through sprints, prioritizing features with our riskiest technical challenges first.*

### Who will do the work

In the DEFINITION phase we learned enough about what we are building to define the correct resources for the work. You will have one main project contact who will act as your product manager. They will:

* Coach you through the progress we are making
* Stay on top of the budget
* Let you know how changes will affect the duration and overall cost
* Modulate resources in and out of your project

### The development process

Within the first few days we will have software deployed to a staging server that you can see. You will be able to see progress and updates made every couple days.

Along with the live code, you will be able to follow along (and input into) our project tracking software, where you can see first hand what is currently under development.

Your input will be vital in prioritizing the features throughout the project.

### How you stay involved

We value transparency in our relationships. So we use, share, and communicate through a project tracking software, which allows you to stay involved without losing important information in email.

Here's how we suggest you staying involved (and what we've seen work best):

1. For any changes or new feature suggestions that you definitely want, add to our project tracking software. That way:
  * they'll get knocked out once they surface as a priority
  * it's easier to consider them against other to-dos
  * it keeps the team focused on building (not emailing back and forth about new feature ideas)

It's definitely OK to bounce thoughts/ideas off of us, but we suggest you hold those for our regular calls when possible to keep things running smoothly and without delay.

2. Keep in mind that what might seem like "small changes" can end up taking hours. For example, something we see with many clients is the tendency to want to tweak a form or the homepage (based on gut feel, not user feedback), even before we build anything.

3. When you do have strong opinions about stuff (which is OK, we realize some things are worth extra time/effort), try to provide as detailed direction as you can, as early as possible. For example if you have a clear vision for what the design of a page should be, sharing that as early as possible will help limit the amount of time the team has to put in.

### Source control, hosting, analytics

We set up as a standard practice:

* Source control (Github)
* Hosting (MediaTemple, Heroku, or Modulous)
* Basic analytics (Google Analytics)

## (DEBUG) What happens after launch?

*The DEBUG phase is everything after we design and implement the planned features. We'll begin testing with real users; iterating on feedback, suggestions, and bug reports.*

### Disappointment (bet you weren't expecting us to say that!)

Since we are working with software, there isn't a magic switch and feeling of the lights turning on for the first time when we "go live". Software launches aren't big parties anymore, and you shouldn't expect a flood of users. You (and us) have spent many hours, blood, sweat, and tears making a great product. We should all be proud of that. The hard work just begins once we start having real users of the product.

### Bugs Will Surface

Even the most astute quality assurance processes can't find all the issues with software until real users start using your product. That is why we maintain 20% of the budget in a "shared account" so that we can handle post-launch activities. If we are working on a monthly billing plan, plan to have a budget for post-launch.

### Users Will Have Good Feature Requests

Since we all work on the web these days, everyone and their brother has thoughts about what software should do. Some of these ideas are great, and some are terrible. The best thing to do is to set a timeframe (we recommend two weeks) before you add new features to the queue. That way, you make these decisions with a clear mind and data vs. emotion.

### Software Will Need Ongoing Support

Software is never done. There is always something to work on and improve. Expect that there will be a list of things to work on after the project is complete. New bugs will be introduced when new technology emerges (new screen sizes, new browsers, new operating systems, etc). At a minimum there is some amount of work to keep the current functionality operational.

## (THE END) How does our relationship end?

*There are a few reasons why our relationship will end, and we like to plan for it in advance*

### Funding has dried up

Too often, we are working with entrepreneurs on an MVP with the goal of acquiring capital from investors, and those investors get cold feet. Many on our team have been through that. When it does happen, let's have an honest conversation, and make a plan to leave the code in a spot where we can pick up again with minimal restart effort, when funding is available.

### You decided to shut the project down

After months of missed user acquisition goals, some clients make the decision to shut down the project. Let us know and we will be able to turn off all charged services so you won't incur ongoing costs.

### Bringing on a new developer

While we would love to be your long-term development partner, sometimes it makes sense to bring someone in-house. We are honest in that we are not going to be your cheapest long-term option. It is important that we know in advance that a change will be occurring so that we can make sure that documentation is in order for the new developer to take over. As part of our services, we can help vet potential candidates.

## And Finally...

### What some of our existing clients had to say

We love our clients, and our clients love us too. Our past and existing clients have been our best advocates. Please ask us if you would like references.
